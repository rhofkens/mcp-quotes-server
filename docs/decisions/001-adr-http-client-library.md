# ADR 001: HTTP Client Library Selection for Serper.dev API Integration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
For Step 2 (Serper.dev Integration & Quote Retrieval Logic), we need to make HTTP requests to the serper.dev API. The step plan mentions choosing between `axios` and `node-fetch` as potential HTTP client libraries. We need to select one that aligns with our TypeScript monolith architecture and provides reliable API communication.

## Decision
We will use **axios** as our HTTP client library for the following reasons:

1. **Built-in TypeScript Support**: Axios has excellent TypeScript definitions and type safety
2. **Request/Response Interceptors**: Provides built-in interceptors for adding authentication headers and handling common errors
3. **Automatic JSON Parsing**: Automatically handles JSON request/response parsing
4. **Timeout Configuration**: Easy timeout configuration for reliability
5. **Error Handling**: Structured error objects with HTTP status codes and response data
6. **Retry Compatibility**: Works well with retry libraries like `axios-retry`
7. **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted in the Node.js ecosystem

## Consequences
- **Positive**: 
  - Consistent error handling and response structure
  - Easy integration with retry mechanisms
  - Better debugging with structured error objects
  - Smaller bundle size compared to alternative libraries
- **Negative**: 
  - Additional dependency in package.json
  - Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with axios (minimal impact)

## Implementation Notes
- Install axios as a production dependency
- Use axios instances with base configuration for the serper.dev API
- Leverage axios interceptors for API key injection and common error handling
