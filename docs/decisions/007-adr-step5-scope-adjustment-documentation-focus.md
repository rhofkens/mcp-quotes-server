# ADR 007: Step 5 Scope Adjustment - Documentation Focus Only

## Status
Accepted

## Context
For Step 5 (Comprehensive Testing & Documentation), the original scope included both achieving 50% test coverage and comprehensive documentation. However, given the time investment already made in testing during previous steps and the need to prioritize project completion, a scope adjustment is required.

## Decision
We will **remove all testing-related tasks** from Step 5 and focus exclusively on **documentation completion**. The scope adjustment includes:

1. **Remove Testing Tasks**: No additional test development, coverage analysis, or test enhancement
2. **Focus on Documentation**: Complete comprehensive documentation for deployment, usage, and contribution
3. **Code Quality**: Maintain basic code quality checks (linting, formatting) as part of documentation preparation
4. **Final Validation**: Limit validation to documentation completeness and basic functionality verification

## Rationale
- **Time Efficiency**: Significant time has already been invested in testing infrastructure during Steps 1-4
- **Project Completion Priority**: Documentation is essential for project usability and adoption
- **Existing Test Coverage**: Current test suite provides adequate coverage for an example project
- **User Value**: Complete documentation provides more immediate value to users than additional test coverage

## Revised Scope for Step 5
- **Documentation Tasks**: README update, deployment guide, usage guide, contribution guide
- **Code Quality**: ESLint compliance, Prettier formatting
- **Basic Validation**: Functionality testing with MCP Inspector and Claude Desktop
- **Project Finalization**: Final acceptance criteria validation focused on documentation completeness

## Consequences
- **Positive**: 
  - Faster project completion
  - Focus on user-facing deliverables
  - Complete documentation suite for project adoption
  - Clear project finalization path
- **Negative**: 
  - No additional test coverage improvements
  - Existing test gaps remain unaddressed
  - Reduced robustness validation

## Implementation Impact
- Total estimated time reduced from 12-15 hours to 4-6 hours
- Focus shifted entirely to documentation and basic code quality
- Final validation limited to essential functionality verification
