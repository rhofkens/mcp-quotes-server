# Detailed Plan: Serper.dev Integration & Quote Retrieval Logic

## 1. Detailed Scope

- **Features:**
  - Integrate with `https://serper.dev` API to fetch quotes.
  - Handle API key configuration by reading `SERPER_API_KEY` from environment variables.
  - Construct search queries based on `person` (required) and `topic` (optional) parameters received by the `get_quote` tool.
  - Make HTTP requests to the `serper.dev` API.
  - Parse the `serper.dev` API response to extract relevant quotes.
  - Implement robust error handling for API calls (e.g., network issues, invalid API key, rate limits, no results found).
- **User Stories (referencing PRD):**
  - As an AI model, I want to request quotes from a specific person and topic, so that I can enrich my responses with relevant information (partial fulfillment of User Story 2).
- **Tasks:**
  - Create a new service module (e.g., `src/services/serperService.ts`) to encapsulate all `serper.dev` API interactions.
  - Update the `get_quote` tool handler to utilize the `serperService` for quote retrieval instead of the placeholder.
  - Implement logic within `serperService` to dynamically construct the search query URL and parameters.
  - Choose and integrate an appropriate HTTP client library (e.g., `axios`, `node-fetch`).
  - Define TypeScript interfaces/types for `serper.dev` API request and response structures.
  - Install and configure Winston logging framework for file-only logging (avoiding console output that would interfere with MCP stdio).
- **Sub-tasks:**
  - Implement basic retry mechanisms for transient API errors.
  - Configure Winston logger with file transports only (e.g., `combined.log` for general logs, `errors.log` for error-level logs) ensuring no console output.
  - Set up appropriate log levels and format for API request/response logging while excluding sensitive data like API keys.
- **Excluded:**
  - Caching mechanisms for frequently requested quotes.
  - Advanced natural language processing (NLP) for quote analysis or sentiment analysis.

## 2. Detailed Acceptance Criteria

- The `get_quote` tool, when invoked with valid `person` and `topic` parameters, successfully makes a request to the `serper.dev` API.
- Quotes returned by the `serper.dev` API are correctly parsed and returned as the result of the `get_quote` tool.
- The `SERPER_API_KEY` is successfully read from environment variables and used for API authentication.
- If the `SERPER_API_KEY` is invalid or missing, the `get_quote` tool returns an appropriate error message via MCP.
- Network errors or other `serper.dev` API failures are gracefully handled, and informative error messages are returned via MCP.
- Unit tests cover the `serperService` module, including query construction, response parsing, and error handling.
- Integration tests verify the `get_quote` tool's end-to-end interaction with a mocked `serper.dev` API, ensuring correct data flow and error propagation.

## 3. Detailed Documentation Tasks

- Update the main `README.md` to include:
  - Clear instructions on how to obtain and set the `SERPER_API_KEY` environment variable.
  - Examples of `get_quote` tool invocation with various combinations of `person` and `topic` parameters, demonstrating expected quote output.
  - Information about any specific `serper.dev` API limitations (e.g., rate limits) that users should be aware of.
- Add JSDoc comments to the `serperService` functions and any new data structures.
- Document the Winston logging configuration in the codebase, including log file locations and rotation policies if implemented.
