# Detailed Plan: Core MCP Server Setup & Basic Tool Definition

## Detailed Scope
The scope for this increment includes:
*   Setting up the basic TypeScript project for the MCP server.
*   Defining the `get_quote` tool with a placeholder response.
*   Ensuring communication is handled via stdio only.
*   Using the [https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) repository as inspiration for the implementation.

Explicitly excluded for this increment are HTTP support and the actual quote retrieval logic.

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria
*   The MCP server initializes without errors.
*   The `get_quote` tool is registered and can be invoked via stdio.
*   Invoking `get_quote` returns the expected static placeholder response.
*   The project structure adheres to defined guidelines.

## Detailed Documentation Tasks
*   Update the `README.md` with basic setup instructions and how to run the server.
