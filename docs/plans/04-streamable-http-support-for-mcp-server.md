# Detailed Plan: Streamable HTTP Support for MCP Server

## Detailed Scope
The scope for this increment includes:
*   Implementing streamable HTTP communication for tool invocation and resource access.
*   Configuring HTTP/HTTPS server capabilities via environment variables.
*   Ensuring stdio communication still functions alongside HTTP.

Explicitly excluded for this increment are advanced security features beyond basic HTTPS setup. This implementation is for a later version of the protocol that supports streamable HTTP.

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria
*   HTTP server starts successfully.
*   Tools and resources are accessible via HTTP.
*   Environment variables control HTTP settings.
*   Stdio still works.

## Detailed Documentation Tasks
*   Update the `README.md` with instructions on how to enable and configure HTTP support.
