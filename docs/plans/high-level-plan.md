| Core MCP Server Setup & Basic Tool Definition     | Initialize the MCP TypeScript server with **stdio support only**, set up basic project structure, define the `get_quote` tool with its input schema, and implement a placeholder response. This increment focuses on getting the MCP server framework operational and demonstrating basic tool exposure.                   | MCP server initializes successfully **and communicates via stdio**. `get_quote` tool is registered and discoverable via MCP. Invoking `get_quote` returns a static, placeholder response. Project adheres to initial coding guidelines (e.g., folder structure, naming).                                                | Initial setup guide for running the server.                              |
| Serper.dev Integration & Quote Retrieval Logic    | Implement the actual logic for calling the `serper.dev` API within the `get_quote` tool. This includes handling API key configuration (environment variables), constructing search queries based on `person` and `topic`, making the HTTP request, and parsing the response to extract quotes. | `get_quote` tool successfully calls `serper.dev` with provided parameters. Quotes are extracted and returned from the `serper.dev` response. Error handling for API calls (e.g., network issues, invalid API key) is implemented. Unit tests for the quote retrieval logic are in place. | Document `serper.dev` API key setup.                                     |
| Prompt Template Resource & Advanced Tool Features | Define and expose the "Prompt Template Resource" via the MCP SDK. Enhance the `get_quote` tool to handle `numberOfQuotes` and refine parameter validation.                                                                                                                                     | "Prompt Template Resource" is accessible via MCP. `get_quote` tool returns the requested number of quotes. Robust input validation for all `get_quote` parameters is implemented. Integration tests verify tool and resource interactions.                                               | Document the Prompt Template Resource usage. Update tool usage examples. |
| Streamable HTTP Support for MCP Server            | Implement support for streamable HTTP communication for the MCP server, allowing it to operate over HTTP/HTTPS. This includes adding configuration options via environment variables to enable/disable HTTP support and configure ports/protocols.                                                 | MCP server can be configured to run with streamable HTTP support via environment variables. Server successfully handles HTTP requests for tool invocation and resource access. Both stdio and HTTP communication can coexist or be independently configured. Basic security considerations for HTTP (e.g., HTTPS option) are addressed. | Document HTTP configuration options (environment variables). Update server deployment guide for HTTP setup. Provide examples for HTTP tool invocation. |
| Comprehensive Testing & Documentation             | Focus on achieving the target code coverage (70%) with unit and integration tests. Finalize all necessary documentation for deployment, usage, and contribution, ensuring adherence to the coding guidelines.                                                                                  | Code coverage meets or exceeds 70%. All critical paths are covered by unit and integration tests. Deployment and usage documentation is complete and clear. Contribution guidelines are documented. All documentation tasks from previous increments are finalized.                      | Finalize README, testing guide, deployment instructions.                 |
