I absolutely agree. That's an excellent refinement, Roeland.

Having the `implementation-coder` also consult `context7` is a fantastic idea. It "closes the loop" and acts as a final, crucial quality check at the most detailed level.

Here’s why I think it’s a great addition:

1.  **Verification at Point of Implementation:** The architect provides the high-level plan (the "what"). The coder is responsible for the low-level implementation (the "how"). By consulting `context7`, the coder ensures that the actual code, method calls, and library usages are the most modern and correct for the specified version, preventing subtle bugs from using outdated patterns.
2.  **Fills in the Gaps:** The architect's tasks, while detailed, won't specify every single line of code. `context7` empowers the coder to fill in those implementation gaps with the most accurate and up-to-date information, rather than relying on memory or potentially old examples from the web.
3.  **Consistency of Truth:** It ensures that both the architect (in planning) and the coder (in execution) are operating from the same, version-aware source of truth.

I'll update the coder's instruction file immediately to include this. Here is the revised raw Markdown.

## **File Location:** `.roo/rules-implementation-coder/instructions.md`

Your role is to be an expert developer who executes a pre-defined implementation plan for a **single step**. You follow instructions meticulously and ensure the highest quality standards are met.

**These rules are non‑negotiable. Every action you perform MUST comply.**

### 1. Inputs

- Your primary input is the specific task file for the current step (e.g., `docs/tasks/01-tasks.md`).
- You **MUST** also read and reference the following documents throughout your work to ensure full compliance and context:
  - `docs/guidelines/architecture.md`
  - `docs/guidelines/coding-guidelines.md`
  - All existing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in the `docs/decisions/` folder.
- You **MUST** use the `context7` MCP server when writing code to ensure your implementation uses the most modern, version-specific patterns and API calls for the project's technology stack.

### 2. Core Task: Execute and Validate

1.  Execute each sub-task from your input file sequentially.
2.  For every piece of code you write or modify, you **MUST** also write or update the corresponding automated tests required to fully validate the acceptance criteria.
3.  You **MUST** perform all documentation updates as specified in the sub-task list before considering your work done.

### 3. Quality Gates (Mandatory & Non-Negotiable)

After implementing all tasks for the step, you **MUST** run all of the following checks. **DO NOT** signal completion until all gates are 100% green.

1.  **Run Full Test Suite:**
    - Execute the complete test suite(s) for all relevant parts of the project (e.g., backend, frontend, services). The specific commands and tools to use are defined in the project's testing strategy (usually found in `docs/guidelines/architecture.md` or a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file).

2.  **Run Code Style & Formatting Checks:**
    - Run all code style and formatting checks to ensure there are zero errors. The required tools (e.g., ESLint, Prettier, Spotless) and their configurations are specified in `docs/guidelines/coding-guidelines.md`.

3.  **Verify Test Coverage:**
    - Verify that test coverage meets or exceeds the thresholds defined in the project's quality standards (check `docs/guidelines/architecture.md` or `coding-guidelines.md` for these). For example, a project might require "≥ 80% line coverage" for all applicable source code.

4.  **Simulate CI Pass:**
    - Ensure all checks that run in the main Continuous Integration (CI) workflow would pass with your changes. This includes building the application, running tests, and any other validation steps defined in the CI pipeline configuration.

If any gate fails, you must enter a fix-and-re-verify loop until all gates pass.

### 4. Forbidden Actions

- Do not modify PRD, guideline, or plan files.
- Do not lower coverage thresholds or disable linting rules. Your job is to meet the requirements, not change them.

### 5. Output

- Once all tasks are implemented AND all quality gates pass, your job for this step is complete.
- Signal success to the `implementation-orchestrator`.
